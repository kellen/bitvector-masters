Unclear in MPG:

How to define modification events for mulitple variables
--

The typing for the different branch function types is not clear if you're not using int; MPG says that:

    In the following type definitions, the type IntVar of the argument x, the return type int
    of the branch value function of type IntBranchVal, and the type int of the argument n is
    dependent on our integer interval variables (they are of type IntVar and they take values of
    type int).

but what about the unsigned int a and int i? Even though it says that these are "as required" it would 
be nice to know what they are and why.


Later, is ValType the same as the internal value type for the variable? Seems like it should be, but 
there's no text about this.

Appears to be a typo in the int.hh file I got from gecode.org: "IntBracnhMerit" line 615 in my version (license comment removed)

Way too much stuff going on in the V section all at once... 
really difficult to build somehting incrementally. C++ is a horrible horrible language.
Should have an example split out into separate files.

should have modificaiton operations defined for multiple variables (not just an int limit gq/lq)



how to implement the minimodel?



the descriptions of value selection and commits are pretty cursory. WHY do these things exist? 
What are they doing? From wehre are they called, etc?
How do users change them when they're not int-based? etc
